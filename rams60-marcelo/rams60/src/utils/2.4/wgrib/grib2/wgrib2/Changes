pre-release  1/2004: Variable names now appear on the inventory. Ok, only 1% of the GRIB names have 
                been typed in and I plan to revise this code.

                 sample eta file lacks grid information but is usable.

                  included by the code.
		    code_table0.dat    CodeTable_1.3.dat  CodeTable_3.1.dat  ncep_tableC.dat

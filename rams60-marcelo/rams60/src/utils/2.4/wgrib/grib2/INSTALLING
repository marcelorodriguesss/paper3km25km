                                           INSTALLING

On a bog-standard linux box, type "make" in the grib2 directory.  If all goes well, you
will get the wgrib2 program in wgrib2/wgrib2.  If you have problems with the netcdf, type
"make -f makefile_no_netcdf".


Note, "make" programs are not standard.  My makefiles assume that you are using the GNU make.
The various compile options have been hardwired for gcc. That's life. 



                                        Comments Netcdf

The netcdf library is included with this distribution.  The library is compiled in enable-C-only
mode only so it may not be that useful for generic code.  So you can change the makefiles to
point to a pre-existing netcdf library; however, you probably won't want to point to this library.

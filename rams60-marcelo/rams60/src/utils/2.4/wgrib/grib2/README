Preliminaries:

   To compile the future wgrib2 (wgrib2.c), you need
the following external libraries,

	/usr/lib/libpng.a
	/usr/lib/libz.a

The latter two libraries are often installed on linux systems
otherwise you will have to get them from the net.


					Compiling


    In the grib2 directory, type "make".  It works my linux box.  If everything goes well, 
you can find the executable in wgrib2/wgrib2.
